  👋 Thanks for opening your first issue on koroneStrap!


  Before we dig in, a few quick tips:

  - 🔍 **Search first** — use the [issue search](https://github.com/LittleBigDevs/koroneStrap/issues) to check if your issue has already been reported or resolved. Duplicates will be closed without a response.

  - 📖 **Check the docs** — many common questions are already answered in the [documentation](https://docs.mrmeowcat.dev/koroneStrap/getting-started).

  - ✅ **Fill out the template completely** — incomplete reports (missing steps, no logs, no OS info) make it very hard to help you and may be closed.

  - 🐛 **Bugs vs suggestions** — if you have an idea rather than a problem, use the Feature Request template instead.


  We'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks for helping make koroneStrap better!
